# This repository is meant to be entirely educational.
There are times when I can't remember exactly what data structure to use, or even how it works. 
This repository has been made to prevent that, so that in the future I always remember how things work.

I'm not sure exactly what will be in this repo, but it will be continuously updated in the near future with different folders, bits of code
and of course documentation explainging what the code does and how it works.

# Feel free to fork this if you find it useful.
